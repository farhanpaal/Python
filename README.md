# 📁 Farhan Pala's Python Learning Vault

Welcome to my Python learning folder — a personal archive where every file tells a story of growth, curiosity, and relentless pursuit of knowledge.

## 🧠 What is this?

This folder contains the Python scripts and snippets I've written while learning from:

- YouTube tutorials 🎥  
- Google searches 🔍  
- Articles, courses, and hands-on experiments 💡  

Each file may look simple, but together they form the foundation of something bigger — the evolution of my coding mindset.

## 🎯 Why did I upload this?

1. **For Future Me**:  
   To look back, review, and build upon the work I've done. This is my growing base of reference material — no matter how small or messy it might look now.

2. **For You, the Visitor**:  
   If you're a beginner, a curious soul, or someone searching for small code snippets to understand a concept — you’re welcome to explore. Take whatever helps you, and improve what doesn’t.

3. **To Stay Accountable**:  
   Uploading this publicly is a reminder that I’m on a long journey — and I’m not afraid to show where I started.

## 💬 A Note from Me
